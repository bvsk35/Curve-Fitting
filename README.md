# Curve-Fitting
Solving Curve Fitting problem using Backpropagation
<pre>
1 - I have implemented Backpropagation Algorithm with Online Learning using Mean Squared Error 
as Loss/Energy Function on a Neural Network.
2 - The architecture of the Neural Network is Input Layer X Hidden Layer X Output Layer (1x24x1).  
3 - Activation function in output layer is phi(v) = v and in hidden layer is phi(v) = tanh(v).
4 - I have also implemented weight decay to make sure that MSE doesn't end up in local minima.
