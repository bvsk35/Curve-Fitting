# Curve-Fitting
Solving Curve Fitting problem using Backpropagation
<pre>
I have implemented Backpropagation Algorithm with Online Learning using Mean Squared Error as Loss/Energy Function on a Neural Network.
The architecture of the Neural Network is Input Layer X Hidden Layer X Output Layer (1x24x1).  
Activation function in output layer is \phi{v} = v and in hidden layer is \phi{v} = tanh(v).
I have also implemented weight decay to make sure that MSE doesn't end up in local minima.
